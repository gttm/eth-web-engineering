# ETH Web Engineering course projects (Spring 2017)
## Exercise 1: Design and Layout using CSS - Responsive Design
In this exercise we recreate the design and layout for a restaurant one-page website based on screen mockups and then make the website responsive.

## Exercise 2: HTML5 - CSS3 - JavaScript/JQuery
In this exercise we develop extensions on the Exercise 1 website to make it more attractive. We use HTML5 semantic tags for the website, CSS3 animations on all the menu items and a popup window showing relevant information for each selected menu item. Moreover we add animation on visible DOM elements in the current viewport and update the menu items based on the position of the Menu section in the current viewport.

## Exercise 3: Turning the website into a WordPress theme
In this exercise we re-engineer the Exercise 2 website prototype and turn it into a WordPress theme. The content of the website can now be managed by WordPress and the theme supports several configurable elements. Moreover, custom post types for Dishes and Events are added and AJAX-based navigability of events to display information of an event is introduced.

## Exercise 4: Node.js gallery cross-device application - Motion-based interactions
In this exercise we build a Node.js gallery application that uses real-time communication between multiple devices. The application consists of two parts. The first is intended to be loaded onto large screens and will only display a single image. The seconded part is designed for mobile devices and displays a set of images. The user can select an image which will be shown on the large screen. The mobile device functions as a remote control to the large screen and supports motion-based interactions: jerk-tilting left/right for the previous/next picture, tilting down/up to zoom in/out the current picture.
